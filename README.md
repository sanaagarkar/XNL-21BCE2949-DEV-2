🔹 Introduction
XNL-21BCE2949-DEV-2 is a cloud-native microservices-based platform built for high scalability, fault tolerance, and real-time data processing. It leverages AI to optimize query performance, automate scaling, and ensure high availability across multiple cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure).

🌟 Why This Project Matters:
✅ Handles complex AI-driven analytics with low latency
✅ Supports dynamic scaling based on traffic and workload
✅ Ensures secure, multi-cloud deployment with automated CI/CD

✨ Core Features
✔️ Microservices-based architecture – Independent, scalable services
✔️ AI-based Query Optimization – Uses ClickHouse for intelligent query handling
✔️ Multi-Cloud Deployment – Provisioned via Terraform (AWS, GCP, Azure)
✔️ Event-Driven Design – Kafka + RabbitMQ for real-time processing
✔️ Authentication & Authorization – OAuth 2.0 + JWT + OpenID
✔️ Monitoring & Logging – Integrated with Prometheus, Grafana, and OpenTelemetry
✔️ Secure Object Storage – MinIO + AWS S3 for file management
✔️ GitOps-Based CI/CD – ArgoCD, Jenkins, and GitHub Actions

🛠 Tech Stack
Frontend:
Next.js – Server-side rendering and performance optimization
Vue.js / Angular – Optional frontend frameworks for flexibility
Backend:
FastAPI (Python) – Auth & Event Processing
NestJS (Node.js) – User Management and Business Logic
Databases:
PostgreSQL – Relational Database for structured data
Redis – In-memory cache for session handling and speed
Cassandra – Distributed NoSQL Database for high-volume data
ClickHouse – AI-powered analytical query engine
Messaging & Search:
Kafka + RabbitMQ – For event-driven architecture
ElasticSearch / OpenSearch – Full-text search capabilities
Infrastructure & Deployment:
Kubernetes – Container orchestration (EKS, GKE, AKS)
Terraform – Infrastructure as Code
MinIO / AWS S3 – Secure Object Storage
ArgoCD + Jenkins + GitHub Actions – For automated CI/CD pipelines
Monitoring & Logging:
Prometheus + Grafana – Real-time monitoring
OpenTelemetry – Distributed tracing and observability
